Countdown to All-Hands 2017 in Florida

## Notes

* Weekdays calculation is a fairly crude, brute-force implementation which probably doesn't scale well
* The real-time counter is not efficient!
* Weekdays do not account for public / bank holidays. Feel free to create a pull request to implement this :)
